            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the preſent ſenſe of our miſeries &amp; Appreheſions of invetible ruine both of Church and Common-wealth maketh us to become humble Suiters to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Aſſembly (the likelieſt means under God for our reliefe) to conſider our diſtreſſed ſtate and to provide a ſpeedy remedy for our preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evils.</p>
            <p>Earneſtly deſiring you to weigh the Care and Judgement of our Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who by a known Law ſettled and preſerved our Proteſtant Religion, our Liberties, and properties with the right underſtanding between King and Subjects, which produced plenty and peace in our ſtreets. And to reflect with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts upon our preſent Diſtempers, violating Religion by Papiſts, and Sectaries, ingaging our Nation in a Civill, bloody, and deſtructive Warre, invading our laws and liberties, indangering all our lives, and utter diſabling us to relieve our diſtreſſed Brethren in Ireland.</p>
            <p>We beſeech you likewiſe to conſider the effect of a countinued Warre, as the deſtruction of Chriſtians, the unnaturall effuſion of blood, Father againſt ſon, Brothers by Brothers, friends by friends ſlain; then a Famine and ſickneſſe the followers of a Civill War, making way for a generall confuſion and Invaſion by a forreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while our Treaſure is exhauſted, our Trade loſt, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diſpeopled.</p>

            <p> Theſe things weighed and inlarged by your Wiſdomes, we doubt not wil be as ſtrong motives in you to labour as in us to deſire a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy peace and happy Accommodation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we humbly crave that not lending an ear to any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of the preſent Warre under what pretence ſoever, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring ought that may increaſe Jealouſies or continuall Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, betweene His Majeſty and his Houſes of Parliament, you will ſpeedily tender His Majeſty (according to his Royall Intimations) ſuch Propoſitions for Accommodation as he may with Honour and ſafety to the whole Kingdome accept.</p>
            <p>For effecting whereof we ſhall be ready to aſſiſt you with the beſt and utmoſt of our abilities; and whilſt you endeavour Peace, we ſhall ſend up our Prayers to Heaven for the bleſſing of Peace upon you, and all that deſire it.</p>

            <head>Certaine Conſiderations upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed Petition.</head>
            <p>AS God and his Church never wanted Enemies, ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and Antichriſt never wanted friends for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of prophanneſſe and Idolatry in all places, it is hard to ſay, whether are more the Enemies of truth and peace with God or friends of error and peace with the Devill: men whom the Apoſtle calls ſenſuall, fleſhly, and Diveliſh, lovers of pleaſures more then Lovers of God, who can ſee no further then this life, fearing more the terrors of man then of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, chuſe rather peace with man, and wrath with God, then the wrath of man and peace with God; the truth of all which doth appeare by a Petition now in agitation; concerning which I have gathered ſome plaine and undeniable obſervations, preſenting them by way of caution unto others from theſe particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The chiefe Compoſers. Of this Petition.</item>
                  <item>2. The Malignant nature. Of this Petition.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:150055:3"/>
            <p> Firſt conſider whether the chief ſticklers and fomenters therof are not notoriouſly known to be Pattentees, Proctors, Delinquents, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, who either have not at all, or any of them in any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſure according to their Eſtates aſſiſted the common cauſe of the Kingdom againſt the common enemy thereof: whoſe pretences though they are for <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>the aid of poore Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet they are men Popiſh, Athieſticall, and prophane in point of Religion ſome whereof (and they not of the loweſt ſort) have moſt prophanely and blaſphemouſly in the preſence of thoſe (who being deſired, denied to ſubſcribe to a Petition for peace without truth) curſed truth, ſaying a pox on truth, give us peace, truth will follow, and let us have peace and the Devill take truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as for the Law, conſider, whether many of them have not gotten their Eſtates by Pattents, a lawleſſe occupation; and as for bleeding <hi>Ireland</hi> let their Receipts ſhew what they have done for its recovery, which will amount to the ſame nothing as the ſumme which they have disburſed for diſtracted England, they are mutinous and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, profeſſing in the preſence of many, that if this Petition died, they will die with it, and if one ſuffer all will ſuffer, with ſuch like mutinous expreſſions.—Theſe are the parties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the nature of this Petition, and ſee if yee finde it not intolerably ſaucy and peremptory againſt the Parliament in many particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt in taxing cloſely but cleerly this preſent Parliament with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration of the <hi>known Laws of the Land,</hi> as if either they were ignorant thereof, or impotent thereby, as not able to repeale or alter the ſame, being made by themſelves in their predeceſſors having power to nul the ſame at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider whether they do not covertly, but unavoidably tax this preſent Parliament, either with indiſcretion in that they preſume to be wiſer then their predeceſſors, and therefore deſire them <hi>to weigh the care and judgment of our predeceſſors, who by a known Law ſetled and preſerved our Proteſtant Religion and Property, &amp;c.</hi> or elſe cloſely implying, that this preſent Parliament accuſeth former Parliaments of folly and unadviſedneſſe in that they have confirmed thoſe things that muſt now be reverſed; either whereof is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable arrogancy and Nationall injury.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider whether they do not tax this preſent Parliament
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150055:4"/>with their tendring unto his Majeſty ſuch Propoſitions hitherto, which he may notwith his honour, and ſafety of the Kingdome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and therefore they deſire that <hi>they would ſpeedily tender unto his Majeſty (according to his regall intimations) ſuch Propoſitions for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, as He may with honour, and ſafety to the whole Kingdome accept.</hi> Whereas it is moſt evidently known, that many Propoſitions have been tendred, and not one either to the diſhonour of the King, whoſe greateſt honour would be to govern his Kingdome by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of his great Councell, and faithfull Parliament, and not by the Malignant Counſells of Papiſts and Traytors, and out-lawed Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: neither hath there bin one Propoſition tendred which doth not moſt uberouſly carry along with it the ſafety and future proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conſider whether the Malignity of this petition doth not appeare in many phraſes and expreſſions ſcattered up and downe therein, as if it were the birth of the ſame womb which hath lately been, very fruitfull in many printed and ſcandalous Pamphlets, in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting reproches, and moſt unworthy ſcandalls, upon both Houſes of Parliament, ſuch as <hi>The known Law of the Land;</hi> aſcribing the <hi>violation of our Religion to Papiſts and Sectaries:</hi> Under which latter word, hath ever bin implied, every man that in any thing hath differed from the Biſhops Innovations, and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church: Thus the malignity of this Petition appeares in the nature of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider the undoubtedly aimed at Conſequences and Tendences thereof, which muſt be ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the raiſing of mutinies, diviſions and diſcontents in the City (the unity whereof is the ruine of the common enemie) that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port hereof in the Countries, whoſe eyes are upon the Citie, may diſcourage the well-affected there, and ſo the common cauſe may meet with reluctancy throughout the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the enemie now very weak and like to fall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for want of Amunition and meanes (the vitall bloud of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) may yet ſtrengthen and encourage themſelves, and make ſhift by plundering, robbing, and ſpoyling the Countrey, to ſpin out a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, knowing that our diviſions here, if continued, will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally advantage them in their bloudy deſignes: and thus theſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall Petitioners as <hi>Ehud</hi> to <hi>Eglon,</hi> cry <hi>peace peace,</hi> to the Kingdom,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150055:4"/>while they ſecretly and maliciouſly endeavour to thruſt a Sword of deſtruction into the bowels thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a third aim'd at effect muſt be this, the ſtiring up of other their Brethren malignant wretches in other parts of the Kingdom, <hi>ad exemplum</hi> to do the like, that ſo they may bring the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome divided againſt it ſelfe to inevitable ruine, whereas by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Almighty, the preſent caſe and endeavour of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by our Forces abroad, and aſſociations of the ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt the common enemy, may put a very ſpeedy and timely end unto theſe preſent troubles, with all advantages both to Church, and State, and deſired aſſiſtance of our poore Brethren in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they now well perceive that they ſhall no longer be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated either in their detected malignity, or unworthy newtrality. but <hi>Nolentes volentes</hi> ſhall be compel'd by juſt aſſeſments and cenſures in their eſtates to help the preſent ſtate of the Kingdom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will now adventure ſuch courſes that may bring all to confuſion, rather then be helpfull, endeavouring like <hi>Judas</hi> for a little moneys ſake, under colour of a kiſſe of Peace, to betray the Kingdome into the hands of violent and bloody men, and although like reverend Pluſh-cloakes, and intelligent States-men they cryed out againſt the Parliament, ſaying, did they not plead the Subjects propertie, loe where is property if they ſhall take what they pleaſe from us? yet they may know, that though we may plead propertie in reſpect of the Kings taxing without Law. yet we can pleade no propertie from the Parliament in a time of imminent danger, into whoſe diſpoſall we have committed our eſtates and all that we have, which we never did to the King, and ſurely were our Parliament as ſelviſh as theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners are, we would all have known long before this time, what the power of Parliament had bin, by our ruine and ſlavery, being not in the tenth meaſure ſo provoked by ſuch ingratitude, and unnatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all provocations, as they have bin.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, conſider what a rocke we may run upon, thus unthankfully to provoke the Parliament, may they not compremiſe differences to their own perſonall ſafety and preferment; and our irrecoverable ſlavery? haue they not us at ſuch advantages, that they may undoe us every houre? can we aledge any thing againſt them wherein they have bin unfaithfull in that truſt we committed to their charge? is it not in the proſecution of our Peace? wherein they meet with ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150055:5"/>frownes and oppoſitions from above? have they not hazarded their eſtates and livelyhoods for us? did not many of them oppoſe with their bloud in their perſonall adventures, the malignity of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and bloudly Army that came againſt their mother Nation? did we not chuſe them becauſe we thought they would be faithfull? and ſhall we diſtaſt them for their faithfulneſſe; hath not the peace and wel-fare of the Kingdom bin pretious in their eyes? let malice it ſelfe produce any inſtance to the contrary: what had become of us before this time had not their care and diligence in ſecuring the Seas prevented thoſe preparations made beyond the Seas by known Traytors to the Kingdom? hath God by them diſcovered ſo many plots? prevented ſo many apparent dangers? freed us from ſo many preſſures and taxations? procured ſo much freedom for us? and do we thus requite them? had they not every day a freſh ointment from above with the Spirit of meekneſſe and love unto the Kingdom, they would make our hearts ake for ſuch daring provocations as this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio n imports.</p>
            <p>In fine, let us follow hard after Peace but harder after Truth, the beſt peace will follow truth, though truth will not follow every peace; let us pray for peace, but of Jeruſalem, not of Babylon; if our peace be enmity to truth, truth will quickly devour our peace: let us admit of a peace upon any termes of perſonall diſadvantage, ſo we engage not the God of peace againſt us; what ever we abate of that which is called ours, yet let us not leave a hoof behinde of all that is called Gods; better it is to purchaſe truth for our poſterity by our bloud, then to betray them by a ſinfull peace. God hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto bin with us, while we have bin with him, if we forſake him he will forſake us: though the Sons of <hi>Anak</hi> be great and tall, yet ſhall God drive them out before us as he hath don: If we honour God by believing, he will honour us by ſucceeding our endeavours; 'tis true God bids us follow peace, but never without Holineſſe.</p>
